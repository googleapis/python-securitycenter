            The MITRE ATT&CK tactic most closely
            represented by this finding, if any.

            The MITRE ATT&CK technique most closely represented by this
            finding, if any. primary_techniques is a repeated field
            because there are multiple levels of MITRE ATT&CK
            techniques. If the technique most closely represented by
            this finding is a sub-technique (e.g.
            ``SCANNING_IP_BLOCKS``), both the sub-technique and its
            parent technique(s) will be listed (e.g.
            ``SCANNING_IP_BLOCKS``, ``ACTIVE_SCANNING``).
        additional_tactics (Sequence[google.cloud.securitycenter_v1.types.MitreAttack.Tactic]):
            Additional MITRE ATT&CK tactics related to
            this finding, if any.
        additional_techniques (Sequence[google.cloud.securitycenter_v1.types.MitreAttack.Technique]):

            this finding, if any, along with any of their
            respective parent techniques.
